# primerevision

This is supposed to be wannabe Anki that sucks, but has additional features.

For one, the default time spacing between revisions isn't based on some arbitrary numbers; 
instead, it's based on a sequence that's based off of prime numbers.

For another, there's the concept of 'n-cycles'.
What that is will be revealed in a YouTube video that will soon follow.
